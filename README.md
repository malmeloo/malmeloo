My name's Mike, but I'm often referred to as DismissedGuy or simply "dismissed."

I often work on my own personal projects, some of which I publish here for all of you to enjoy. Although I mainly code in python, you could hype me up with anything remotely tech-related. This also means I get distracted fairly easily, causing me to abandon a lot of interesting projects 😅.

My main and most popular project right now is [Wiimmfi-RPC](https://github.com/DismissedGuy/wiimmfi-rpc).
